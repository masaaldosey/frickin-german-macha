I need to learn frickin German macha. So, I made this repository.

> :question: So, what is your plan of action boi?

## Plan of Action

I have split up the learning process into the following 3 basic steps:

1. Learning the noun genders
2. Learning the German case system and be able to identify the noun case
3. Learning the declensions and the declension pattern

> :question: Okay. Tell me more about each of these steps.

## Noun Gender

Every noun in the German language is associated with one of the three genders - *der* (masculine), 
*die* (feminine), *das* (neutral). It is important to know the gender of a given noun as it helps 
to identify the correct **declensions** which accompany it. There are two tricks to learn the noun 
gender:

- learn via the common *noun endings* or,
- learn via the common *noun groups*.

I choose to learn via both as it covers almost all of the cases out there. I color code the different genders:

- **red** for *der* (masculine),
- **blue** for *die* (feminine),
- **green** for *das* (neutral),

and created a set of [flashcards](flashcards/noun_gender.pdf). The cards can be printed two-sided on a A4 sheet. 
I did this as I don't want to reduce my screentime. Also, who doesn't love some time away from gadgets and do 
things the old way once in a while. :wink:
